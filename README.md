## Python Repository

This is a small repository for all my beginner projects in Python. These exercises were completed during a course, with a little help from ChatGPT for generating the texts and comments

## Projects
### Selector
The code randomly selects a friend's name from the list and prints the chosen friend, suggesting who the user should FaceTime today.

### Rock, Paper and Scissors
The code defines a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It prompts the user to input their choice ('r' for rock, 'p' for paper, 's' for scissors) and randomly selects a choice for the computer. The function `is_win` determines the winner based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.

### Random Madlibs
The code imports different madlibs (Harry Potter, Code, Zombie, Hunger Games) from the sample_madlibs module. It then randomly selects one of these madlibs and calls its madlib() function to generate and display a madlib story. 

### Madlibs Samples
This `madlib()` function prompts the user for various inputs (such as body part, verb, adjectives, nouns, etc.) and then uses these inputs to generate and print a madlib story

### Login
The code simulates a basic authentication sistem, and the script uses the time module to introduce delays, creating a loading effect.
