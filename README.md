## Python Repository

This is a small repository for all my beginner projects in Python. These exercises were completed during a course, with a little help from ChatGPT for generating the texts and comments

## Projects
### Selector
The code randomly selects a friend's name from the list and prints the chosen friend, suggesting who the user should FaceTime today.

### Rock, Paper and Scissors
The code defines a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It prompts the user to input their choice ('r' for rock, 'p' for paper, 's' for scissors) and randomly selects a choice for the computer. The function `is_win` determines the winner based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.

### Random Madlibs
The code imports different madlibs (Harry Potter, Code, Zombie, Hunger Games) from the sample_madlibs module. It then randomly selects one of these madlibs and calls its madlib() function to generate and display a madlib story. 

### Madlibs Samples
This `madlib()` function prompts the user for various inputs (such as body part, verb, adjectives, nouns, etc.) and then uses these inputs to generate and print a madlib story

### Login
The code simulates a basic authentication sistem, and the script uses the time module to introduce delays, creating a loading effect.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

    Give an example

## Deployment

Add additional notes to deploy this on a live system
