Welcome to the "python_projects" repository! This space is dedicated to sharing the projects developed during my Python course, aiming to solidify learning, explore various areas of Python programming, and enhance language skills.

Here are a couple of the projects:

- **selector.py:** A simple random selector for facetime decisions, dealing with imports.
- **login.py:** A fake login allowing to simulate hacking into a super-secret mainframe lol, practicing if statements, imports, and print statements.
- **madlibs.py:** Classic madlibs! Practicing with inputs and strings.
- **rock_paper_scissors.py:** The classic rock, paper, scissors game, involving functions and if statements.
- **web_app:** My own web app using Flask!
